Django app that try to load template by it's file 
name passed in url. It is useful in development for quick template 
rendering without overhead of defining urls for each template. 
It may be helpful for work with designers as designers will be 
able to write Django templates (with inheritance and all the 
template tags) instead of raw HTML and don't care about writing 
views and urlconfs. Do not use it in production as this approach 
is insecure.
